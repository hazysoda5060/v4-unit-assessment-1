        <h2>About HTML5</h2>
        <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
            It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
            The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors
            (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
        <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
            Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features;
            to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
            such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
            HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
