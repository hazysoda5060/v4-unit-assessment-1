        <h2>About HTML5</h2>

        <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
            It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
            The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors
            (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
        <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
            Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features;
            to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
            such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
            HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

        <h2>About CSS3</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and Javascript.</p>
        <p> CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, color, and fonts.
            This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,
            enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complevity and repitition
            in the structural content. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page
            in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
            and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS a;sp has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
            this priority scheme is predictable.
        </p>
        <p>The css specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME types) text/css is registered for use with
            CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
